## Unreleased - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Paper learning laat nu meerdere gelijktijdige paper probes en recovery-probes toe via een aparte concurrentielimiet, zodat paper niet meer effectief op nul open posities hoeft te wachten voor de volgende leercase.
- Capital governor geeft paper nu expliciet recovery-leniency mee, zodat dashboard en risklogica zichtbaar maken dat paper tijdens recovery nog kleine leertrades mag openen terwijl normale entries geblokkeerd blijven.
- Paper-learning runtime and dashboard views now expose `scopeCoaching` and a compact `reviewQueue`, so you can see the strongest scope, the weakest scope, and which probe/shadow/active-learning case deserves manual review first.
- Paper-learning summaries now include compact `coaching` guidance, experiment-scope recommendations, and benchmark deltas versus the real probe lane so operators can see faster where paper is too strict, too loose, or ready for the next sandbox/probation step.
- Paper-learning summaries now expose richer active-learning prioritization with focus scopes, candidate priority bands, and expanded benchmark baselines such as `always_take`, `fixed_threshold`, and `simple_exit`.
- Counterfactual shadow review now compares extra branch paths (`market_entry`, `tighter_stop`, `longer_hold`) so blocked paper setups teach more than only baseline, smaller size, maker bias, and earlier exit.
- Offline trainer now exposes a concrete `retrainExecutionPlan` with cadence, selected scopes, probation scopes, rollback-watch scopes, and an operator action so retraining can be scheduled and reviewed instead of inferred from readiness alone.
- Replay chaos summaries now include a `deterministicReplayPlan` that selects the next replay pack from paper misses, near-miss blocked setups, and probe winners for faster operator review.
- The README now documents a concrete codebase roadmap focused on retrain governance, deterministic replay, operator visibility, and rollback-safe promotion.
- Offline trainer now exposes a compact `retrainFocusPlan` that highlights the strongest and weakest retrain scopes, counts ready/building/warmup scopes, and recommends the next retrain action instead of only reporting raw readiness scores.
- Retrain governance now ranks concrete retrain scopes by family and regime, so paper/live history can point to which parts of the dataset are actually mature enough for broader retraining.
- Offline trainer now exposes a dedicated `retrainReadiness` layer for paper and live, using trade counts, strategy/regime diversity, record quality, lineage coverage, source/context coverage, and recorder bootstrap state to decide how mature broader retraining really is.
- The data recorder now has a historical bootstrap loader that reads recent stored decisions, trades, learning, news, contexts, and curated datasets on startup to build a warm-start summary for runtime and paper/governance views.
- Data-recorder quality is now tracked per record kind, including `news` and `context_*`, so it is easier to see whether historical learning, replay, or source-history data is the weakest part of the stored dataset.
- Data-recorder summary now tracks compact `sourceCoverage` and `contextCoverage` aggregates, so runtime, dashboard, and dataset curation can show which news providers and event context types actually dominate the stored history.
- Recorder frames now carry a compact `recordQuality` score for decision, trade, learning, and replay records, so later training and review loops can filter by completeness/confidence instead of treating all records equally.
- `status`, `doctor`, and dashboard snapshots now expose a cleaner recorder summary with average/latest record quality, lineage coverage, and hot/cold retention context instead of raw recorder state blobs.
- Historical `context_history` recorder frames for Binance announcements and macro/calendar summaries, so replay and offline analysis can now reuse event context instead of only generic news history.
- Data-recorder schema v4 with explicit `news_history` and `dataset_curation` frames, so historical news, datasource lineage, and curated training views are now stored alongside decision and replay data.
- Hot/cold feature-store retention with automatic archive compaction, allowing recent recorder data to stay fast while older files move into an archive tier before deletion.
- Recorder-level dataset curation summaries for paper learning, veto review, exit learning, execution learning, regime learning, and historical news coverage.
- Decision, trade, learning, and replay frames now persist richer datasource-lineage context including data quality, confidence breakdown, feature completeness, and fallback/degraded source state.
- A concrete data-storage roadmap in the README covering feature-store layers, lineage, historical news, dataset curation, retention, and replay-grade storage.
- Paper-learning summaries now expose `paper-to-live readiness` and a compact `counterfactual tuning` view, so the strongest paper scope and the current blocker/tuning direction are visible in runtime and dashboard output.
- Paper learning now exposes blocker groups (`safety`, `governance`, `learning`, `market`) plus per-scope readiness across strategy families, regimes, and sessions.
- A paper-only threshold sandbox now applies small, bounded scope-level threshold shifts in paper based on recent closed paper outcomes instead of changing the main policy globally.
- The dashboard paper-learning card now shows strongest paper scope, active threshold sandbox context, and automatic review-pack hints.
- A dedicated paper-mode roadmap v2 in the README covering experiment lanes, sandboxing, blocker splitting, scope readiness, review packs, and operator visibility.
- Paper probe-diversification now also tracks session usage, so probes can be spread across market hours instead of only strategy families and regimes.
- Replay/chaos summaries now build automatic replay packs for probe winners, paper misses, and near-miss blocked setups to speed up paper review loops.
- Paper-learning summaries now compute a dedicated readiness score/status, so paper can be read as `warmup`, `building`, or `paper_ready` instead of only lane counts.
- The dashboard system-status area now includes a compact paper-learning card with readiness, probation, top blocker, and top outcome for faster operator review.
- Paper replay/chaos summaries now count recent paper misses (`bad_trade`, `early_exit`, `late_exit`, `execution_drag`) as explicit replay review signals instead of only relying on blocked setups and trade stress.
- Paper-learning summaries now expose a lightweight probe probation state with `promote_candidate`, `rollback_watch`, or `observe`, so paper probes can be reviewed with clearer promotion intent.
- A concrete paper-mode roadmap in the README, plus paper-learning diversification limits per strategy family and regime so probes collect broader training data instead of clustering in the same scopes.
- Paper-learning runtime summaries now surface dominant blockers and the most common recent learning outcomes, making it easier to see why paper is blocked and what it is actually learning from.
- Closed paper trades now carry explainable `paperLearningOutcome` labels with entry, exit, risk, and execution quality buckets for faster paper-only tuning and review.
- A canonical `marketState` contract layered on top of the existing trend-state engine, with stable `direction`, `phase`, `trendMaturity`, `trendExhaustion`, `rangeAcceptance`, `trendFailure`, `dataConfidence`, and `featureCompleteness` fields for runtime, dashboard, backtest, and research consumers.
- Explicit scan-mode wrappers for `scanCandidatesReadOnly()`, `scanCandidatesForCycle()`, and `scanCandidatesForResearch()` so observability and production paths can stay readable without duplicating scan logic.
- A rate-limited exchange-truth refresh loop for non-cycle runtime paths, allowing `doctor`, `status`, and dashboard snapshots to refresh live reconcile truth without waiting for a full trading cycle.
- Discord and Telegram operator-alert delivery channels alongside the existing generic webhooks, keeping alert fan-out config-driven and still safe to mock in tests.
- Research-candidate governance fields `robustnessScore`, `uniquenessScore`, and `promotionStage`, so imported/genome strategies now surface paper-readiness with more explainable scoring.
- Stable decision/ops alias contracts for `marketState`, `riskPolicy`, `executionBudget`, and `capitalPolicy`, reducing dashboard/runtime contract drift without breaking existing payloads.
- Region-aware Binance capability resolution with a conservative Belgium profile, plus defensive bear-market handling for spot-only accounts.
- A new `bear_rally_reclaim` strategy path aimed at monetizing downtrends through spot-safe capitulation/reclaim setups instead of assuming shorting access.
- Persisted order-lifecycle, exchange-truth, shadow-trading, service, and operator-ops state in the runtime schema so restarts and dashboards can reason about position state instead of only raw open positions.
- Threshold-tuning recommendations, exit-learning scorecards, feature-decay tracking, calibration governance, and regime-deployment summaries in the offline trainer.
- Exchange-truth mismatch summaries that count runtime-vs-exchange inventory drift and can freeze new live entries when reconcile risk is too high.
- Position-level failure budgets that degrade repeated management failures into `protect_only` and `manual_review` states instead of retrying the same risky automation every cycle.
- Dashboard/operator views for lifecycle state, incident timeline, runbooks, performance-delta notes, shadow entries, threshold tuning, exit learning, and feature decay.
- Watchdog status-file output plus exponential restart backoff in `Run-BotService.ps1`.
- Crash-safe pending live action journaling so entries, exits, protective-order rebuilds, and exchange recovery steps survive restarts with explicit lifecycle state.
- Dashboard health and readiness endpoints that surface live blockers such as exchange-truth freezes, lifecycle manual-review states, and circuit-open health failures.
- Execution-calibration feedback that derives paper slippage, maker fill bias, latency, and queue-decay adjustments from recent live fill telemetry.
- Auto-applied threshold probation with scoped rollback rules, so high-confidence threshold recommendations can be trialed and reverted without manual intervention.
- CVaR, drawdown-budget, and regime kill-switch controls in the portfolio allocator alongside the existing exposure and factor budgeting.
- Safe strategy-DSL normalization and validation for imported strategy ideas, with hard blocks on unsafe patterns such as martingale, average-down, unlimited pyramiding, and unsupported execution styles.
- Automated strategy-research mining that combines whitelisted imports, native seed strategies, deterministic genome mutations, and Monte Carlo stress scoring into paper-ready candidate lists.
- A neural strategy meta-selector that learns preferred strategy families and execution styles per market context and feeds that guidance into entry sizing, threshold bias, and execution planning.
- Reference-venue confirmation summaries and capital-ladder staging that can downgrade sizing, keep live in shadow, or block entries when external price confirmation or deployment readiness falls behind.
- Parameter-governor scopes that learn bounded threshold, stop, take-profit, scale-out, hold-time, and execution-aggressiveness adjustments from closed-trade outcomes.
- Shared candidate insight summaries for `dataQuality`, `signalQuality`, and per-layer `confidenceBreakdown`, so runtime, risk, and dashboard all reason over the same explainable quality model.
- Shared trend-state phase classification with explicit `early_ignition`, `healthy_continuation`, `late_crowded`, `range_acceptance`, and transition labels.
- A central `capitalPolicy` snapshot that reuses existing allocator, governor, and ladder state to expose factor, cluster, regime, and family budget pressure without introducing a duplicate portfolio stack.
- Explicit lifecycle `recoveryAction` recommendations per tracked position and pending action, plus disappearance journaling when a pending exchange action vanishes without a terminal record.
- Semi-incident-response operator controls for `force reconcile`, `mark reviewed`, `allow probe-only`, and resolve-with-note flows across runtime, manager, dashboard API, and UI.
- Richer counterfactual labels (`good_veto`, `bad_veto`, `late_veto`, `right_direction_wrong_timing`) so blocker feedback can distinguish timing problems from clean vetoes.

### Improved
- Paper mode now learns more aggressively but still safely: informative blocked setups can become `shadow` cases earlier, mild local-book/data degradation can still permit tiny `paper_recovery_probe` entries, and paper-only exploration/recovery cooldowns are shorter so learning loops do not stall behind live-style throttles.
- Paper-learning shadow reviews now include active queued review cases alongside resolved counterfactuals, so the dashboard no longer shows an empty `Shadow cases` block while branchable shadow learning is still in progress.
- Replay chaos now keeps `paperMisses` and `probeWinners` strictly paper-only, so paper-learning review packs and dashboard learning context cannot be polluted by live trades.
- Paper-learning shadow reviews now only show actual branchable shadow cases, so the learning block no longer gets polluted by generic counterfactual history without replay value.
- Missed-trade analysis now narrows recent counterfactual matches by regime as well as blocker, strategy, and phase, and the dashboard learning card now correctly prefers explicit probation notes over generic sandbox copy.
- Dashboard decision views now prefer explicit runtime `operatorAction` and `autoRecovery` text, and also translate legacy `probe_only` codes into readable operator guidance.
- Recorder warm starts now rebuild `lastRecordAt` and `latestRecordQuality` from actual feature-store file truth instead of stale restored timestamps or bucket ordering.
- Dashboard operations now surface retrain-batch and replay-pack context directly inside the paper-learning block, so the next retrain and replay actions are visible without digging through raw runtime payloads.
- Recorder frame counters now rebuild from actual feature-store files on disk instead of trusting persisted summary counters, so restores and manual recoveries stay aligned with file-truth state.
- Decision records now flow through the shared recorder write path, which means `recordQuality`, `averageRecordQuality`, and `qualityByKind` finally include decision history instead of only trade/learning/replay-style frames.
- Cached news and announcement/context reuses are now written once per cache snapshot to historical recorder storage, so offline review can distinguish fresh fetches from cached and fallback-backed runtime use.
- Calendar history capture now follows the same once-per-cache-snapshot pattern and its service constructor is runtime-dir safe, removing a fragile edge case during tests, restores, and lightweight service wiring.
- Paper-learning lane counts now survive dashboard refreshes by rebuilding `safe / probe / shadow` from same-day trades, open positions, and shadow-history instead of only the latest cycle decisions.
- Dataset curation summaries now also surface recorder data-quality state such as lineage coverage, archived file counts, and hot/cold retention windows.
- Normalized operator alerts around explicit `new`, `acked`, `silenced`, and `resolved` states, and surfaced those states directly in dashboard actions and payloads.
- Reused the canonical market-state wrapper in regime inference, strategy routing, risk, backtest, and research paths instead of leaving trend semantics implied by only raw trend-state fields.
- Strengthened runtime explainability so decision payloads now carry market-state aliases even when older consumers still depend on `trendState`.
- Hardened exchange-capability normalization so persisted string values like `"false"` no longer flip regional shorting flags back on in runtime summaries or downtrend guards.
- Split paper-mode leniency into `paper_exploration` versus `paper_recovery_probe`, so capital-governor recovery can keep learning with tiny probe sizing while market/data-quality blockers still stay hard.
- Deepened model-promotion governance so regime readiness now sits beside threshold, exit, calibration, and feature-health feedback instead of only paper/live scorecards.
- Extended replay cards with veto-chain and alternate-exit context so post-trade review shows more than entry/exit prices alone.
- Refreshed status serialization so live runtime output now includes lifecycle and operator layers end-to-end.
- Documented the new tuning and watchdog knobs in `.env.example`.
- Tightened exchange-truth reconciliation so open orders, order lists, stale protective state, and recent fills all participate in live freeze decisions and recovery guidance.
- Expanded operator dashboards with readiness summaries, active lifecycle actions, lifecycle journals, threshold probation context, and execution-calibration status.
- Deepened exit learning with strategy- and regime-scoped exit policies that tune scale-outs, trailing behavior, and hold windows per context.
- Expanded dashboard governance, research, and operations panels with imported-strategy scorecards, parameter-governor summaries, venue-confirmation status, and capital-ladder state.
- Clarified dashboard decision cards so paper-only candidates now show whether they were a generic warm-up or a capital-recovery probe, plus which guardrails were consciously relaxed.
- Kept imported strategy candidates as raw DSL records in runtime state instead of recycling scored seed/genome output, preventing governance refreshes from inflating or corrupting follow-up research inputs.
- Extended the execution planner so strategy-meta and governor signals can nudge maker preference and sizing without bypassing the existing safety clamps.
- Unified regime, strategy-routing, and risk tuning around the same shared trend-state summary instead of parallel heuristic branches with slightly different weights.
- Added explicit sideways/range-acceptance detection using directional persistence, structure, acceleration, VWAP acceptance, and breakout follow-through instead of treating range as only “not trend”.
- Expanded the indicator/feature layer with anchored VWAP acceptance/rejection, upside-versus-downside realized volatility split, trend failure scoring, and richer trend maturity/exhaustion signals.
- Added relative-strength signals versus BTC, ETH, cluster peers, and sector peers so continuation and relative-weakness context reaches runtime decisions without introducing a duplicate trend engine.
- Added close-location quality, breakout follow-through, volume acceptance, and replenishment-quality signals to the shared feature stack and regression coverage.
- Added explicit read-only scan isolation for preview/research paths so candidate scans no longer retarget the local-book universe while observing runtime state.
- Added replay/chaos scenario tagging for stale book, venue divergence, missing news, protection rebuild issues, and partial fills so failure patterns surface earlier in operator review.
- Added lifecycle invariant summaries and tuning-governance summaries to the dashboard snapshot so operators can see hard-stop lifecycle states and active threshold/governor promotion context in one place.
- Added richer operator-cockpit explanations on decision cards with explicit operator action, auto-recovery context, and degraded datasource labels.
- Improved dashboard decision visibility with explicit trend phase, confidence breakdown, signal-quality, data-quality, dominant source states, and clearer risk-layer blocker context.
- Applied the shared trend-state semantics to backtest and research contexts as well, reducing live-vs-offline feature drift without a broad refactor.
- Made doctor preview scans read-only and bounded candidate evaluation with concurrency limits, reducing accidental runtime/journal mutation and improving scan latency on larger universes.
- Tightened risk de-risking around crowded trends, fragile breakout follow-through, and healthy downtrend mean-reversion traps while keeping the new confidence layer bounded enough for paper warm-up entries.
- Expanded replay chaos output with recommended actions per active scenario, so stale book, divergence, protection, and partial-fill risks now surface as concrete operator follow-ups instead of only counts.
- Tightened operational readiness so unresolved critical alerts now require acknowledgement before the bot is considered re-enabled.
- Made `probe-only` a real runtime behavior by shrinking allowed entry sizing during operator-controlled recovery windows instead of only surfacing a dashboard label.
- Deepened paper, backtest, and research execution realism with session-biased fill delay, maker miss rate, queue refill/cancellation effects, and partial-fill recovery cost attribution.
- Surfaced the new capital-policy and lifecycle recovery context directly in dashboard operations cards and action rows for faster incident handling.
- Expanded offline veto learning so blocker scorecards now track late-veto and timing-issue patterns alongside classic good/bad veto counts.

### Fixed
- Wired the live `NewsService` into the recorder so fresh news fetches are actually written into historical storage instead of the new news-history path existing only on paper.
- Removed the leftover Reddit RSS provider implementation and its dead config hooks so paper/live news collection no longer risks noisy `429` Reddit warnings from stale code paths.
- Fixed operator-alert runtime state migration so restored runtimes now always carry the new `resolvedAtById` store without breaking older persisted JSON.
- Paper-learning lane counts, scope summaries, and shadow review context now stay paper-only instead of letting live shadow/counterfactual cases leak into paper dashboard learning summaries after refresh.
- Paper-mode risk history now ignores live trades, live scale-outs, and live probe/shadow activity when computing capital pressure, loss streaks, and paper-learning budgets, so paper no longer gets stricter from mixed-mode history.
- Paper-learning now counts closed probe trades on their exit day in the dashboard summary, and the capital governor now stays mode-safe by ignoring live PnL/drawdown history when paper evaluates recovery and blocking state.
- Fixed dashboard/operator alert actions so alerts can now be resolved explicitly instead of only acknowledged or silenced.
- Fixed strategy-research summaries so newer robustness/uniqueness scoring survives serialization into runtime and dashboard snapshots.
- Closed a new threshold-policy bug where the `adjust` state could effectively never trigger because the shift floor was stricter than the maximum recommendation size.
- Paper-learning `shadow` counts now include real branchable counterfactual review cases from the queue/history instead of only explicit `learningLane: shadow` items, so the dashboard no longer underreports blocked setups that are still feeding the review loop.
- Prevented `openBestCandidate()` from crashing in lightweight prototype-based tests when `this.config` is absent.
- Kept recovered/rebuilt live positions explicitly marked as `reconcile_required` or `protected` so lifecycle state no longer goes stale after broker recovery paths.
- Fixed scale-out protection recovery so failed protective rebuilds now leave a clear reconcile state instead of silently falling back to a generic open position.
- Stopped per-position exchange sync failures from aborting the broader reconcile pass; failed symbols now degrade into `reconcile_required` while the rest of the book still updates.
- Cleared stale protective-order assumptions when exchange order-list truth disagrees, so later rebuilds can recover instead of believing a dead protective order still exists.
- Fixed strategy-research persistence so imported candidates no longer get replaced by summarized scorecards, which previously risked lossy rescoring and self-referential research growth across governance refreshes.
- Fixed candidate quality/explainability contract drift so live `once`/`status` output now carries trend-state, data-quality, signal-quality, and confidence summaries end-to-end instead of dashboard fields falling back to zeroed placeholders.
- Fixed doctor preview behavior so observability scans no longer mutate blocked-setup journals, universe runs, or latest-decision runtime state.
- Fixed the relative-strength candidate-scan path so runtime smoke runs no longer fail on a missing shared `average()` helper import while building peer-strength summaries.
- Fixed paper exploration regressions so `trade_size_below_minimum` can still be treated as a paper-only soft blocker during tiny warm-up probes instead of shutting exploration off entirely.
- Fixed dashboard/operator decision context so session, drift, and self-heal blockers also generate concrete operator guidance instead of silently missing the action layer.
- Fixed dashboard decision serialization to stay null-safe when lightweight test/runtime stubs do not yet carry the full `runtime.capitalPolicy` tree.
- Fixed lifecycle invariants so disappeared pending actions are now flagged explicitly instead of silently dropping out of operator visibility.

## Unreleased - 2026-03-10

### Added
- TradingView-style ADX/DMI, Supertrend, Stoch RSI, MFI, CMF, and Keltner squeeze/release signals across the AI feature pipeline.
- Exit intelligence v2 with stronger hold, trim, trail, and close decisions wired into runtime and trade replay.
- Trade quality scoring, universe rotation, model promotion rules, and execution quality monitoring in the AI control loop.
- Richer feature-store learning frames so closed paper/live trades persist model, signal, rationale, and indicator context for retraining.
- Feature-store and persisted runtime schema versioning so recorder frames, runtime state, and journals can migrate forward without silent contract drift.
- Data quorum summaries that classify candidates as `ready`, `watch`, `degraded`, or `observe_only` based on local book, provider ops, pair health, divergence, and event quality checks.
- Offline trainer veto-feedback scorecards per blocker plus regime scorecards so counterfactual misses can directly inform governance and promotion readiness.
- Symbol-level risk guards for per-pair daily entry caps and cooldowns after recent losing exits.
- Clock sync quality telemetry with midpoint-sampled Binance time checks and fresher doctor output.
- Local order book bootstrap wait and warm-up tracking so startup depth confidence ramps in more cleanly.
- Cross-timeframe consensus between lower and higher timeframe market snapshots, wired into scoring, risk, and meta gating.
- Pair-health monitoring and quarantine scoring so symbols with repeated infra/data quality issues cool off automatically.
- Source reliability engine that degrades or cools down flaky news providers after rate limits, timeouts, or repeated failures.
- Live-vs-paper divergence monitoring, offline trainer readiness, and probation-aware model promotion governance.
- On-chain-lite stablecoin liquidity context plus counterfactual replay for blocked trade follow-up analysis.

### Fixed
- Restored recorder and backup manager state on restart so dashboard counts reflect files already on disk.
- Repaired light and dark theme application so both `html` and `body` switch together and persist correctly.
- Cleaned stale runtime `.tmp` files during boot to avoid orphaned state artifacts after interrupted saves.
- Migrated older runtime and journal files forward to the latest persisted shape so new quorum/governance fields do not disappear on pre-existing state.
- Blocked self-heal from auto-switching a live bot to paper while exchange positions are still open; the manager now stops instead of orphaning live inventory under a paper broker.
- Hardened live entry recovery so partially filled entries either auto-flatten immediately after downstream failures or stay under runtime management while further entries are blocked for that cycle.
- Fixed live protective-order lifecycle drift so canceled or `ALL_DONE`-without-fill OCOs clear stale IDs and can be rebuilt instead of leaving positions falsely marked as protected.
- Stopped stale websocket book tickers from overriding fresher market data after disconnects by expiring them and falling back to fresh local-book snapshots.
- Retried Binance non-JSON failure responses, including user-data listen-key endpoints, so transient HTML/empty `5xx` pages do not bypass the retry layer.
- Fixed portfolio ranking so stronger allocator scores now improve setup ordering instead of accidentally penalizing the best-shaped candidates.
- Synced dashboard/runtime summaries with the new indicator payloads and persisted learning telemetry.
- Fixed dashboard fold cards and nested detail panels so user collapse state survives polling refreshes instead of reopening every few seconds.
- Restored blocked-setup dashboard cards so self-heal, session, and drift safety flags survive the decision-view serialization layer.
- Fixed the trade-open pipeline so dashboard `Go` states no longer imply an order was sent; decisions now expose `opened`, `eligible`, `runtime_blocked`, `entry_failed`, and `standby` explicitly.
- Stopped paper mode from being unnecessarily blocked by live-only clock drift, funding settlement, self-heal low-risk, and symbol repeat guards so the bot can keep learning during paper runs.
- Reworked market snapshot prefetching to honor cache freshness, scan budgets, and concurrency limits, reducing timeout-driven fallback snapshots.
- Excluded stablecoin lookalikes such as `USD1` and `PYUSD` from the dynamic top-100 Binance watchlist so the bot focuses on real trading candidates.
- Stopped false `clock_drift_too_large` alerts caused by compensated Windows clock offset; health checks now judge effective sync uncertainty instead of raw offset.
- Smoothed local order book startup behavior by waiting for early depth packets, downgrading warm-up gaps, and clamping negative depth ages from exchange-ahead timestamps.

### Improved
- Reworked the dashboard into a simpler operator layout with a smaller top section, cleaner navigation, and one collapsed advanced analysis layer.
- Simplified top setup and open position cards so the AI explains why a trade is allowed or blocked with fewer, clearer signals.
- Reduced visible density by showing fewer setups, blocked trades, replay cards, and recent trades at once.
- Extended governance and blocked/setup views with veto-learning, regime-readiness, and data-quorum context instead of only aggregate promotion stats.
- Improved paper execution realism with queue-decay, spread-shock, and liquidity-shock penalties flowing into execution attribution.
- Isolated per-position management failures so one symbol can fail review without preventing the rest of the open book from being evaluated that cycle.
- Expanded portfolio allocation with factor budget and factor heat controls on top of the existing cluster/sector/family/regime exposure checks.
- Added persistent detail memory for dynamic setup, position, and replay cards so manual open-close choices stick across refreshes.
- Tightened universe, attribution, replay, and blocked-trade lists into a more compact operator view.
- Lowered the default live drift threshold to a meaningful sync-quality guard now that clock health uses RTT-aware sampling rather than raw offset magnitude.
- Expanded doctor/status/dashboard output with pair health, source reliability, divergence, offline trainer, and on-chain-lite summaries.
- Extended the feature pipeline and learning labels so paper/live outcomes can teach model quality, execution regret, and blocked-trade counterfactuals.

## 2026-03-12

- live retrain-readiness krijgt niet langer onterecht een bootstrap-bonus zodra alleen paper warm-start data rijk genoeg is
- calendar context-history wordt nu per symbool één keer per cache-snapshot vastgelegd, zodat cached/fallback macro-context voor meerdere symbols niet stil wegvalt uit learning en review
- dashboard hero/blocker samenvattingen gebruiken nu eerst leesbare operatoruitleg uit geblokkeerde setups en vervormen volledige zinnen niet langer met een ruwe code-`titleize`
- performance reports now keep `openExposure` finite even when one open position contains invalid numeric values
- the dashboard learning summary now prefers the latest trade from the active bot mode, so paper learning cards no longer accidentally surface a mixed-mode recent trade first
- hero/dashboard blocker summaries now prefer readable operator guidance before internal blocker codes, so the top status line stays consistent with the signal cards
- dashboard/operator views now translate common blocker reasons like `capital_governor_blocked`, `model_confidence_too_low`, `higher_tf_conflict`, and `execution_cost_budget_exceeded` into readable action guidance instead of surfacing raw internal codes
- paper-learning scope summaries now keep family/regime/session context across refreshes by rebuilding from recent paper trades and shadow history instead of only the latest visible decisions
- fixed a dashboard action-tone bug where operator guidance could render as negative too eagerly because of boolean precedence in the top status cards
- tightened scoped threshold and missed-trade matching so strategy+regime experiments and governance scorecards no longer overcount unrelated history
- added `paper roadmap v3` features: active learning scoring, benchmark lanes, confidence miscalibration tracking, counterfactual branching, failure library, and recency-weighted paper readiness
- extended paper counterfactual queue resolution with alternative execution/size/exit branches
- preserved `probabilityAtEntry` on closed paper trades so paper-learning calibration can compare predicted conviction with realized outcomes
- paper recovery probes can now stay active through soft governance and learning blockers like `committee_veto`, strategy-context mismatch, and cooled strategy/cluster/regime budgets instead of being shut down too early
- paper learning now treats branchable shadow review evidence as first-class activity for readiness, active-learning focus, and session/family/regime coverage even when the current cycle has no explicit probe decisions
- paper learning dashboards now build probe/shadow daily usage from runtime and journal truth instead of stale candidate snapshots, so refreshes stay consistent with actual queue/history activity
- unresolved counterfactual shadow cases are now retried instead of disappearing immediately when a snapshot is temporarily missing or invalid
- paper learning, missed-trade analysis and offline retrain summaries now ignore `resolution_failed` counterfactuals so temporary snapshot issues do not pollute learning quality, blocker scorecards or shadow benchmarks
- retrain readiness and scope-ranking are now freshness-aware, so stale paper/live history weighs less heavily than recent closed trades when deciding whether a broader retrain run is actually mature enough
